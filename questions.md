1. why do I need to download the condition models twice:
    - they are part of the flux model repository https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell
    - they got downloaded by the load_model function https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux/blob/87f6fff727a377ea1c378af692afb41ae84cbe04/src/flux/util.py#L129
